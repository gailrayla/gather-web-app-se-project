# GATHER Web Application

## About the Project

GATHER is a web application project developed as part of a Software Engineering course (CSE346) at UNIST (Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology). The project aims to create a platform for arranging group study gatherings and facilitating social connections among students on campus.

## Milestone 1: Setting Up the Foundation

In this milestone, we established the foundation for our web application using the following technologies:

- **Docker:** We utilized Docker to containerize our applications and their dependencies, streamlining the deployment process.

- **Spring Boot:** The core of our web application is powered by Spring Boot, providing a robust and efficient framework for building Java-based applications.

- **Rest API:** The web architecture of GATHER was constructed using Rest API, enabling seamless communication between components.

- **Maven:** To simplify our build process and manage dependencies efficiently, we integrated Maven into our project.

- **MongoDB:** We chose MongoDB as our database management system due to its excellent performance potential, allowing us to store and retrieve data effectively.

## Milestone 2: Core Features Implementation

GATHER serves as a platform for UNIST students to connect and organize various activities, such as study sessions, meals, and social gatherings. Key features include:

- **Creating Posts:** Users can effortlessly create posts detailing their plans, specifying the subject, time, and location.

- **Searching Posts:** A powerful search feature enables users to discover relevant posts based on keywords, interests, and more.

- **Commenting:** Users can engage in meaningful discussions by leaving comments on posts, fostering collaboration and interaction.

- **User Registration:** A user registration system is in place to facilitate seamless interaction among students.

## Milestone 3: Frontend Enhancement with React

In this phase, we integrated React into our project for a more dynamic and user-friendly frontend experience. The application is now deployed and accessible for use.
